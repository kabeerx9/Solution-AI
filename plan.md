## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** Too ambitious timeline
**Mitigation:** Focus on absolute essentials first (medications, tasks). Document storage can wait if needed.

**Risk:** Supabase complexity
**Mitigation:** Use Supabase client libraries, follow their docs closely, start simple.

**Risk:** Notification issues
**Mitigation:** Test notifications early and often. Have fallback (in-app reminders).

**Risk:** Real-life doesn't match design
**Mitigation:** Stay flexible, adjust features based on actual usage.
